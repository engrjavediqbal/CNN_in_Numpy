# CNN_in_Numpy

This notebook explains the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implementation in Numpy. All related concepts, are implemented from scratch. A dynmic structure is defined model architecture where one can define a network of their own choice. The example data of CIFAR-10 is used to evaluate the implementation. 

Usage:
  1. Downlaod the notebook to a directory.
  2. Download the [data](https://uc6802c91eb6c46e8a06d32a2749.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/get/AgB2TcCJ9-ilIIqLT6FQbLQsV6KXumPdd5ZgBvt70c41ee_qY1xWDy9-GLmd0NG9nCzBdwDvmXPBW72M3-k2P3TQtAMdLKuIaYbhw8vhsqcp0UG6VqPjy5BnTb_WWhLILr8/file#) provided and place in the same directory.
